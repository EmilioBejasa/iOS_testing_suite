# iOS Test Kit

A Weather demo app (SwiftUI + Open-Meteo) used to build out and prove a reusable iOS
testing setup: a Swift package of test helpers, plus GitHub Actions workflows any
iOS repo can call by reference instead of copy-pasting CI config.

## What's reusable

### `NetworkStub` (Swift Package product)

`URLProtocolStub` intercepts requests on a configured `URLSession` so any
`URLSession`-based network client can be tested against canned responses. The only
requirement on the app side is that the client accepts an injectable `URLSession`.

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/EmilioBejasa/iOS_testing_suite", from: "1.0.0")
// target dependency: .product(name: "NetworkStub", package: "iOS_testing_suite")
```

```swift
import NetworkStub

let configuration = URLSessionConfiguration.ephemeral
configuration.protocolClasses = [URLProtocolStub.self]
let session = URLSession(configuration: configuration)

URLProtocolStub.handler = { request in
    let response = HTTPURLResponse(url: request.url!, statusCode: 200, httpVersion: nil, headerFields: nil)!
    return (response, cannedJSON)
}
```

### `UITestHelpers` (Swift Package product)

An `XCUIApplication` extension for looking up elements by accessibility identifier
without guessing which `XCUIElementType` SwiftUI backed it with, plus a small
launch helper.

```swift
import UITestHelpers

let app = XCUIApplication().launched(withArguments: ["--mock-success"])
XCTAssertTrue(app.element("myList.list").waitForExistence(timeout: 5))
```

### Reusable GitHub Actions workflows

`.github/workflows/reusable-test.yml` runs `xcodebuild test` across a matrix of
simulators, reports code coverage, and uploads the `.xcresult`. Call it from any
repo:

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    uses: EmilioBejasa/iOS_testing_suite/.github/workflows/reusable-test.yml@master
    with:
      scheme: MyApp
      project: MyApp.xcodeproj
      devices: '["iPhone 16", "iPad (10th generation)"]'
      skip_testing: "MyAppTests/LiveContractTests"
```

`.github/workflows/reusable-live-contract.yml` runs a single test identifier
against a real network on a schedule, kept separate so a live API hiccup can't
block a PR:

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 13 * * *"

jobs:
  contract:
    uses: EmilioBejasa/iOS_testing_suite/.github/workflows/reusable-live-contract.yml@master
    with:
      scheme: MyApp
      project: MyApp.xcodeproj
      only_testing: "MyAppTests/LiveContractTests"
```

Both workflows assume XcodeGen by default (`xcodegen: true`); pass `xcodegen: false`
if your project already checks in an `.xcodeproj`.

## The Weather app

Everything under `Weather/`, `WeatherTests/`, and `WeatherUITests/` is a working
consumer of the above: `project.yml` pulls in this same repo as a local Swift
package (`packages: iOSTestKit: path: .`), and `.github/workflows/ci.yml` /
`live-api-contract.yml` call the reusable workflows with Weather-specific inputs.
Read those two files as the reference example for adopting this in another project.
